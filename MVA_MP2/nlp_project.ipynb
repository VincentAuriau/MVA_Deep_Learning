      "1 the film is strictly routine .\n",
      "3 a lyrical metaphor for cultural and personal self-discovery and a picaresque view of a little-remembered world .\n",

      "1 will undoubtedly play well in european markets , where mr. besson is a brand name , and in asia , where ms. shu is an institution , but american audiences will probably find it familiar and insufficiently cathartic .\n",
